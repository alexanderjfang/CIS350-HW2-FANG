## Technical Background ##
When I was in middle school, I saved up for my first laptop. In high school, I built my own computer and learned how to code. I have made a dedicated server for Garry's Mod using Lua. I also enjoy making fun pictures and videos to share with my friends on the internet. I have familiarity with the languages C, Java, Python, Lua, and HTML. Currently, I am working in a group to make a checkers game, but I would like to make a website in my freetime for my friend's and family's businesses.
